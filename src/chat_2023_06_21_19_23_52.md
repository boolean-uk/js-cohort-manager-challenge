1. **You**: Why is there a bug in this code?: 
```javascript
  removeStudent(fullName) {    const [firstName, lastName] = fullName.split(' ')    let student = {}    for (let i = 0; i < this.cohorts.length; i++) {      student = this.cohorts[i].find(        (student) =>          student.firstName === firstName && student.lastName === lastName      )      console.log(`testing ${i}`, this.cohorts[i])      console.log(student)    }  }
```
